			<p > As you can see, I'm kinda new to this HTML/CSS thing; I'm mainly coding in C++ and Java but have always wanted to create my own website, so here we are. Anyways, now that you are here here's a little info about me. 
			</p> <br></br>
			<p>My name is Hunter Noey and I am a recent Cum Laude graduate from Texas State University. I consider myself one of the stereotypical college students (without the partying)
			   when it came to picking my major originally, but I am extremely grateful I stayed with Computer Science. My bread and butter languages are C++ and Java, but also know C#, Assembly, 
			   and C. This page is coded in HTML and CSS, but I am only a novice in these. If you would like to see some of the more interesting school projects (most notablly Computer Networks and Parallel Programming), shoot me an email at HunterNoey@outlook.com. I am currently working on two projects, those being a Nanogram Generator and this Website. The Nanogram Generator is a revival of an old project
			   from 2018 that got abandoned (originally "Ye Olde Nanogram Nanic"), but without 20 midterm weeks I have some quality time to pick back up on it. Before I showcase it, I would like to make some noteworthy progress. This Website is also on my list currently, 
			   as I've always wanted to get into web-development. I'm pretty bad at it, but it's a lot of fun to see the website raise from the ground up! 
			</p><br></br>
			<p>Exercise is without a doubt my favorite thing to do when I'm not coding. While I'm by no means going to be signing a multi-million dollar contract with the Cowboys anytime soon,
			   I adore running mileage and lifting weights in my free time. I also plan on investing in a quality bike and becoming a cyclist once I get a job, and am looking forward to building a gym. Whether you want to get your mind off things or want to get pumped up, exercise is always the way to go!</p> <br></br>
			<p>I consider myself a junkie when it comes to music. Whether its pulling all-nighters coding up Hello World or working up a sweat on the trails, I'm always for music. Bullet For My Valentine takes the cake for my favorite band, but I enjoy a vast variety of generes such as 
			   Heavy Metal, Rap, 80s music, and Alternative. With this variety I've confused many of my former students when playing music due to the unpredictability. Picking a Top Song is the hardest part when generating this website, but after some deep thought I'd have to go "Alone" by Bullet For My Valentine. 
			   To make up for only naming my favorite song, below is a playlist with my Top 50 Favorite songs as well as a few of my favorite albums, so feel free to listen after reading!</p><br></br> 
				<p> Television and movies are something I haven't been into lately, but I do enjoy something good on TV from time-to-time. My Top 3 movies are Forrest Gump,
				Scarface, The Dark Knight and top 3 shows are South Park, The Big Bang Theory (can't do the final 7 seasons), and Ed Edd n Eddy. </p> <br> </br>
				<p>Whelp  that sums me up, I hope I convinced you I'm not a robot! Now that graduation is in the books, I am now ready to start my career as a Software Developer. With my tenure as a student-instructor at Texas State University, I 
				believe I have what it takes to leave an immediate impact on the organization that chooses to give me a shot. Whether it be late nights hitting the books or countless hours learning the programming standard, I will do whatever it takes to 
				be a key team player. </p><br></br><br></br><br></br>
